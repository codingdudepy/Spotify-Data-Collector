# FAQ
Frequently asked questions or possible questions asked about the application
<ul>
  <li>Can it get personal playlists? As of now it cannot get custom made playlists even if public</li>
  <li>What did I use? So essentially the whole application is built off the spotify api which you can find <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/">here</a>. I also used the python wrapper which you can find <a href="https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/">here</a> if your looking to create your own application. You could always just make a request which is displayed in the docs for the spotify api. But setting it up via wrapper is slighly a bit easier but doesnt make a big difference.</li>
  <li>Can I get paid? Well yes so any of my projects if you make a good pull request that can majorly help the website like designs, etc. I will pay you for your work. I mainly use etheruem but I could send you a gift card as well</li>
  <li>Is it still in development? So everything I built for this website is pretty much done unless the spotify api updates with more functionality. However if theres functions you would like seen let me know.</li>
 </ul>
